		<p><strong>It all started</strong> when A. J. Hackett (at that time, a young Auckland builder with a love of thrill sports) discovered a Pentecost Island ritual, whre men throw themselves off 35m wood towers, attached to vines by their ankles. This ritual was believed to ensure a good yam harvest.</p>
		<p><strong>This daring activity</strong> appealed to Hackett, but he didn't put it into action until he met a fellow Aucklander Chris Sigglekow in the early 1980s. Chris, working as a video editor, had seen 1970s footage of a British group calling themselves the Oxford University Dangerous Sports Club (or OUDSC) doing a modern version of the ritual Hackett saw. But the OUDSC took it to the next level - instead of homemade towers, they jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge in San Fransisco. Chris had already attempted this, but as the jump didn't go as planned, he shelved the idea until he met AJ.</p>
		<p><strong>The pair decided</strong> that if they could make the activity consistently safe, they would pursue the idea further. They approached the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, where they found a mathematical formula for bungy cord rubber.</p>
		<p><strong>In 1986,</strong> armed with their new bungy cords, AJ and Chris went to the Greenhithe Bridge in Auckland to test it. They threw a test weight (a punching bag full of lead and rocks) over the side - and it worked. Then, it was their turn to take the plunge... and it all worked. AJ and Chris went another two times before packing it up and leaving.</p>
		<p><strong>From then on,</strong> AJ and Chris started more ambitious jumps, from the 44m Auckland Harbour Bridge to the several 80m bridges across the North Island without getting noticed by the authorities for several months.</p>
		<p>They later attemped many other locations, including out of a helicopter, off the Eiffel Tower and even out of a cable car in the French mountains. The police finally got onto them, saying it was risky and unsafe. However, the publicity of the Eiffel Tower jump wiped this doubt from any thrill-seekers mind...</p>
		<h3>And the rest, they say, is history.</h3>
